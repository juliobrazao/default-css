                <p>
                This page was built using <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> properties, for the code 
                writing I always use <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and their plugins to agile the process. Pre-processors 
                as <strong>LESS</strong> was also used to make the work of nesting easier.
